# AI Tutor RAG System

Welcome to the **AI Tutor RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System** repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to support the RAG course, focusing on techniques for enhancing AI models with retrieval-based methods.

## Course Notebooks

You can find all the course notebooks in the [notebooks](./notebooks) directory. These notebooks cover various aspects of building and fine-tuning RAG models, providing both theoretical background and practical, hands-on examples.

## Running the Notebooks

You have two options for running the code in these notebooks:

1. **Run Locally**: You can clone the repository and run the notebooks on your local machine. To do this, ensure you have a Python installation with the necessary dependencies.
2. **Run on Google Colab**: Each notebook includes a link at the top to open it directly in Google Colab, making it easy to run without local setup.

## About This Repository

- **Audience**: Designed for students and professionals interested in AI and natural language processing.
- **Topics Covered**: The notebooks cover foundational and advanced concepts in retrieval-augmented generation, including:
  - Data retrieval techniques
  - Model integration with retrieval systems
  - Practical applications of RAG in real-world scenarios

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and explore the notebooks at your own pace. Whether running them locally or in Colab, these notebooks will guide you step-by-step, enhancing your learning experience.

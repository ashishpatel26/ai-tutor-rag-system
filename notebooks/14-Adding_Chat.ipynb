            "\tText\t I. Llama 2: Revolutionizing Commercial Use Unlike its predecessor Llama 1, which was limited to research use, Llama 2 represents a major advancement as an open-source commercial model. Businesses can now integrate Llama 2 into products to create AI-powered applications. Availability on Azure and AWS facilitates fine-tuning and adoption. However, restrictions apply to prevent exploitation. Companies with over 700 million active daily users cannot use Llama 2. Additionally, its output cannot be used to improve other language models.  II. Llama 2 Model Flavors Llama 2 is available in four different model sizes: 7 billion, 13 billion, 34 billion, and 70 billion parameters. While 7B, 13B, and 70B have already been released, the 34B model is still awaited. The pretrained variant, trained on a whopping 2 trillion tokens, boasts a context window of 4096 tokens, twice the size of its predecessor Llama 1. Meta also released a Llama 2 fine-tuned model for chat applications that was trained on over 1 million human annotations. Such extensive training comes at a cost, with the 70B model taking a staggering 1720320 GPU hours to train. The context window's length determines the amount of content the model can process at once, making Llama 2 a powerful language model in terms of scale and efficiency.  III. Safety Considerations: A Top Priority for Meta Meta's commitment to safety and alignment shines through in Llama 2's design. The model demonstrates exceptionally low AI safety violation percentages, surpassing even ChatGPT in safety benchmarks. Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse. Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving\n",

However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving an optimum balance that allows the model to be both helpful and safe is of utmost importance. To strike the right balance between helpfulness and safety, Meta employed two reward models - one for helpfulness and another for safety - to optimize the model's responses. The 34B parameter model has reported higher safety violations than other variants, possibly contributing to the delay in its release.  IV. Helpfulness Comparison: Llama 2 Outperforms Competitors Llama 2 emerges as a strong contender in the open-source language model arena, outperforming its competitors in most categories. The 70B parameter model outperforms all other open-source models, while the 7B and 34B models outshine Falcon in all categories and MPT in all categories except coding. Despite being smaller, Llam a2's performance rivals that of Chat GPT 3.5, a significantly larger closed-source model. While GPT 4 and PalM-2-L, with their larger size, outperform Llama 2, this is expected due to their capacity for handling complex language tasks. Llama 2's impressive ability to compete with larger models highlights its efficiency and potential in the market. However, Llama 2 does face challenges in coding and math problems, where models like Chat GPT 4 excel, given their significantly larger size. Chat GPT 4 performed significantly better than Llama 2 for coding (HumanEval benchmark)and math problem tasks (GSM8k benchmark).

Open-source AI technologies, like Llama 2, continue to advance, offering strong competition to closed-source models.  V. Ghost Attention: Enhancing Conversational Continuity One unique feature in Llama 2 is Ghost Attention, which ensures continuity in conversations. This means that even after multiple interactions, the model remembers its initial instructions, ensuring more coherent and consistent responses throughout the conversation. This feature significantly enhances the user experience and makes Llama 2 a more reliable language model for interactive applications. In the example below, on the left, it forgets to use an emoji after a few conversations. On the right, with Ghost Attention, even after having many conversations, it will remember the context and continue to use emojis in its response.  VI. Temporal Capability: A Leap in Information Organization Meta reported a groundbreaking temporal capability, where the model organizes information based on time relevance. Each question posed to the model is associated with a date, and it responds accordingly by considering the event date before which the question becomes irrelevant. For example, if you ask the question, \"How long ago did Barack Obama become president?\", its only relevant after 2008. This temporal awareness allows Llama 2 to deliver more contextually accurate responses, enriching the user experience further.  VII. Open Questions and Future Outlook Meta's open-sourcing of Llama 2 represents a seismic shift, now offering developers and researchers commercial access to a leading language model. With Llama 2 outperforming MosaicML's current MPT models, all eyes are on how Databricks will respond. Can MosaicML's next MPT iteration beat Llama 2? Is it worthwhile to compete\n",

For the purpose of demonstration, I have gathered publicly available analyst recommendations to showcase its capabilities. You can replace this with your own information to try this. Below is a partial extract of the information commonly found in these documents. If you wish to try it yourself, you can download analyst recommendations for your preferred stocks from online sources or access them through subscription platforms like Barron's. Although the example provided focuses on analyst recommendations, the underlying structure can be utilized to query various other types of documents in any industry as well. I have assembled such data for a few stocks for demonstration purposes. This includes Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla. To facilitate easy access and updating of analysts' recommendations, all the recommendations can be organized into a designated folder. Each stock corresponds to a separate file within this folder. For example, if there are recommendations for 20 stocks, there will be 20 individual files. This organization enables convenient updating of information for each stock as new recommendations arrive, streamlining the process of managing and maintaining the most up-to-date data for each stock.  Questions this Q&A bot application can answer The data we have for this application is stock market analyst recommendations for many stocks. Let's say you are looking for insight about Microsoft stock.

The loaded files can then be saved into a list. This list serves as the input that is sent to the vector database to store the data. The alternative approach is a more versatile method in which we can load all pertinent documents from a designated folder and store the file locations in a list for subsequent processing. This approach offers flexibility and allows for the efficient handling of multiple documents by capturing their locations in a centralized list, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.  Load the documents into the vector store. When dealing with a vast number of documents, it becomes inefficient to send all documents (analyst recommendations) to your large language model (LLM) when seeking answers to specific questions. For instance, if your question pertains to MSFT, it would be more cost-effective to only send document extracts that reference MSFT to your LLM for answering the question. This approach helps optimize resource utilization. To achieve this, all documents are split into chunks and stored in a vector database in a numeric format (embeddings). When a new question is posed, the system queries the vector database for relevant text chunks related to this question, which is then shared with the LLM to generate an appropriate response. Within the LangChain framework, the VectorstoreIndexCreator class serves as a utility for creating a vector store index. This index stores vector representations of the documents (in chromadb), enabling various text operations, such as finding similar documents based on a specific question. When a user asks a question, a similarity search is performed in the vector store to get document chunks relevant to the question. The question, along with the chunks are sent to OpenAI to get the response back. Now we are ready to query these documents.

Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse. Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving an optimum balance that allows the model to be both helpful and safe is of utmost importance. To strike the right balance between helpfulness and safety, Meta employed two reward models - one for helpfulness and another for safety - to optimize the model's responses. The 34B parameter model has reported higher safety violations than other variants, possibly contributing to the delay in its release.  IV. Helpfulness Comparison: Llama 2 Outperforms Competitors Llama 2 emerges as a strong contender in the open-source language model arena, outperforming its competitors in most categories. The 70B parameter model outperforms all other open-source models, while the 7B and 34B models outshine Falcon in all categories and MPT in all categories except coding. Despite being smaller, Llam a2's performance rivals that of Chat GPT 3.5, a significantly larger closed-source model. While GPT 4 and PalM-2-L, with their larger size, outperform Llama 2, this is expected due to their capacity for handling complex language tasks. Llama 2's impressive ability to compete with larger models highlights its efficiency and potential in the market. However, Llama 2 does face challenges in coding and math problems, where models like Chat GPT 4 excel, given their significantly larger size. Chat GPT 4 performed significantly better than Llama 2 for coding (HumanEval benchmark)and math problem tasks (GSM8k benchmark).

Llama 2: Revolutionizing Commercial Use Unlike its predecessor Llama 1, which was limited to research use, Llama 2 represents a major advancement as an open-source commercial model. Businesses can now integrate Llama 2 into products to create AI-powered applications. Availability on Azure and AWS facilitates fine-tuning and adoption. However, restrictions apply to prevent exploitation. Companies with over 700 million active daily users cannot use Llama 2. Additionally, its output cannot be used to improve other language models.  II. Llama 2 Model Flavors Llama 2 is available in four different model sizes: 7 billion, 13 billion, 34 billion, and 70 billion parameters. While 7B, 13B, and 70B have already been released, the 34B model is still awaited. The pretrained variant, trained on a whopping 2 trillion tokens, boasts a context window of 4096 tokens, twice the size of its predecessor Llama 1. Meta also released a Llama 2 fine-tuned model for chat applications that was trained on over 1 million human annotations. Such extensive training comes at a cost, with the 70B model taking a staggering 1720320 GPU hours to train. The context window's length determines the amount of content the model can process at once, making Llama 2 a powerful language model in terms of scale and efficiency.  III. Safety Considerations: A Top Priority for Meta Meta's commitment to safety and alignment shines through in Llama 2's design. The model demonstrates exceptionally low AI safety violation percentages, surpassing even ChatGPT in safety benchmarks. Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse.

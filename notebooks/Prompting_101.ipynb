            "As of my last update in October 2023, Google Gemini is a suite of AI models developed by Google, which includes capabilities for natural language understanding and generation. If you want to use Google Gemini for summarizing multiple documents, you would typically follow these steps:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Access the Model**: Ensure you have access to the Google Gemini model. This might be through an API provided by Google Cloud or another platform where the model is hosted.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Prepare Your Documents**: Gather the documents you want to summarize. Ensure they are in a format that can be processed by the model (e.g., plain text, PDF, etc.).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Preprocess the Documents**: Depending on the input requirements of the Gemini model, you might need to preprocess your documents. This could involve cleaning the text, removing unnecessary formatting, or splitting the documents into manageable chunks if they are too large.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **API Integration**: Use the API provided by Google to interact with the Gemini model. You will need to authenticate your requests, typically using an API key or OAuth token.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Send Requests**: Send the documents to the model for summarization. This might involve sending each document individually or batching them together if the API supports it.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Handle Responses**: Collect the summaries returned by the model. You might need to post-process these summaries to combine them or format them as needed.\n",
